<Beginner>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** is a self-sufficient DPS build, which is not entirely relying on support from the party. This is achieved by bringing slightly more than 50% <Boon name="Quickness" /> to the party. Further, this build brings <Boon name="Stability"/> for the team. Don't be fooled though; the DPS sacrifice is neglectable so that the <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> maintains consistent very high DPS. In addition to that, a free utility slot allows the <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> to adapt to almost any situation and fill the parties' needs ideally. The DPS version should not be played in the slot of a <Boon name="Quickness" />-provider. Instead, it is a fully fledged DPS class! The added <Boon name="Quickness" /> will help to cover potential gaps in <Boon name="Quickness"/> application and alleviate some of stress the <Boon name="Quickness" />-provider might face.

If you want to take the role of a DPS <Boon name="Quickness" /> provider, you can run the <Specialization text="Condi Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> build. This is a great introduction to a DPS boon provider role in fractals, with strong support to help your party providing things like <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/>, and utility such as reflects. Whilst maintaining permenant <Boon name="Quickness" /> and helping out with some extra <Boon name="Fury"/> and <Boon name="Might"/>. 

This is a great build to get started in fractals as you provide a base amount of supportive utility. As you progress through fractals and discover new depths of the immersive gameplay of Guild Wars 2, you can tweak this build more and more. Before reading the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You also should be able to hit more than 45% <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime on the DPS build, and close to 100% on the Quickness build (measure this with the [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) boon table [addon](https://github.com/knoxfighter/GW2-ArcDPS-Boon-Table)). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

<Advanced>

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** can provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> (if necessary) to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. Your tomes are by far your most important skills; they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Tomes cover almost the entire toolbox of defensive capabilities such as boons like <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, but also reflects and pulls and condi cleanses. Knowing where to find these defensive skills is an important part of supporting your team as a DPS player.

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therefore also a great build for soloing content:

- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Some <Boon name="Might"/> uptime.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider, or for people that want to be more independent of their groups.

<Warning>

There are a couple of different gear, utility, and trait setups that allow you to maintain quickness that can be situationally chosen. Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear for the boon durations listed below:

- <Trait name="Liberators Vow"/>, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> (not using final charge), and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> (using final charge) - Minimum duration 29.73%bd
- <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> (using final charge) and <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> - Minimum duration 55.33%bd

You will want the following weapons to swap to during fractal runs:

- Greatsword for pulling adds in Nightmare CM after MAMA and some T4s
- A staff for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking.
- If you have low might uptime you can change <Item id="48911"/> to <Item id="24562"/>.

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your gear. If you are struggling to maintain <Boon name="Quickness"/> and need to take extra boon duration, you can either swap runes to <Item id="83338"/> and adjust your stats, or use utility that will give extra <Attribute name="Concentration"/>.

If you want to play a more supportive variant with better access to <Boon name="Stability"/>, follow the gear and traits on the beginner page.

| <Trait name="Liberators Vow" size="big" disable text/> | This can be taken if you want to play <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> for safer <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime. It is advisable to adjust your gear if you regularly plan to take this trait using the <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> values at the top of the page. |

To keep up <Boon name="Quickness"/>:

- Use <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> whenever ready
- Use all charges of <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/> when it is charged. You shoud recharge the skill when you have downtime betwween phases, or when auto-attacking on Scepter.
- Use <Skill name=" mantraofsolace"/> Keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> does <Boon name="Quickness"/> only every seven seconds (<Trait name="liberatorsvow"/>)!
- Only use these skills close to your allies - try to "puke" on them with the mantras
- Keep in mind that equipping or stowing a tome grants you 3 seconds of <Boon name="Quickness"/> every 8 seconds thanks to <Trait name="swift scholar"/>!

The <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> and <Skill name="Tome of Resolve"/> are great for high incoming damage scenarios.

<Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.

<Skill name="Tome of Courage" />:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.

### Rotation

<Warning>

**Make sure to only press <Skill id="9089"/> three times (twice to throw the projectile and once to activate the skill initially) or you will cancel a wasted cast! Never interrupt your axe auto-attack chain! Keep <Skill name="purgingflames"/> on cooldown!**

</Warning>

Axe Opener:

1.  <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> (Axe 2)
2.  <Skill id="9104"/> (Torch 4)
3.  <Skill name="purgingflames"/>
4.  <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> (F1)
5.  <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>
6.  <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/>
7.  <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/>
8. <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> (Axe 3)
9. <Skill id="9089"/> (Torch 4)
10. <Skill id="9089"/> (Torch 4)

Make sure to cast all charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Flame"/> where possible and recharge the skill during downtime.

</Advanced>

<Beginner>
### Step-by-Step Rotation

**Step 1: Quickness**

- Use 1 charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> and all charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/>.
- Whenever a charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> comes back, use it again, keeping 2 charges for when you need healing. Keep using and recharging <Skill name="Mantra of Potence"/> off cooldown. You can cast these while casting other skills as they are instant-casts.
- Note: Using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/> more often than every 7 seconds will not result in more <Boon name="Quickness"/> due to the cooldown of <Trait name="Liberator's Vow"/>.

**Step 2: Basic Skills**

Start by using the following 3 skills off-cooldown in this order of priority:

1. <Skill name="Purging Flames"/>
2. <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/>
3. <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>

**Step 3: F1 Tome**

Every 15 seconds enter <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/>, and do the following rotation:

1. <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>
2. <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/>
3. <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/>

You can use your <Skill name="Purging Flames"/> to time this, since it has the same cooldown as <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>.

**Step 4: Torch 4**

Lastly, add <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> to your rotation.

- If you press <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/>, you will gain a stack of <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> that you can throw at your enemy.
- <Trait name="Radiant fire"/> will give you an additional <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> every 10 seconds.
- Once you have 2 charges, throw both of them.

Note: Unless you execute the rotation perfectly, this will eventually de-sync. Once this happens, just use both the <Skill name="Zealots Fire"/> you get from <Trait name="Radiant fire"/> and <Skill name="Zealots Flame"/> off-cooldown.

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

</Beginner>
<Advanced>
<Card title="Precasting">

<Warning>

The most important part is to get the precast of Ashes of the Just right! You have to start the fight quickly to not lose the stacks since they only last 10 seconds!
</Warning>

1.  Use <Skill name="hallowedground"/>
2.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="holystrike"/> and/or <Skill name="Hammer of Wisdom"/>
3.  While casting: Use 3 charges of <Skill name="mantraofpotence"/> and share <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> (keep in mind that <Skill name="mantraofsolace"/> only shares <Boon name="Quickness"/> once every 7 seconds thanks to <Trait name=" liberators vow"/>)
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Open <Skill id="44364"/> and use <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/>
6.  Take the _Mistlock Singularity_
7.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> again
