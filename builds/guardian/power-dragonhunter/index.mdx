<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is a high-burst DPS class for fractals. It provides medium defiance bar damage (CC), high amounts of vulnerability through <Trait name="symbolicexposure"/>, and good defensive capabilities through <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>. At the cost of personal DPS, it can access <Specialization name="Guardian" text="Guardian"/>'s strong supportive utilities, such as <Skill name="standyourground" />, <Skill name="wallofreflection" />, and <Skill name="advance" />.

It also has a decent toolkit for skips in Tier 4 fractals with multiple leaps and teleports (<Skill name="wingsofresolve" />, <Skill name="leapoffaith" />, <Skill name="judgesintervention" />, <Skill name="mercifulintervention" />).

Due to its bursty nature, <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is reliant on fast CC and short phases in order to reach its full potential. The build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Guardian"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 150 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

This build relies on almost permanent <Boon name="Aegis"/> uptime to perform well. If you cannot maintain this consider playing Radiance.

This setup uses <Item id="37132"/> to crit cap. If you don't want to use <Item id="37132"/>, swap all Berserkers gear to Assassins.

For fights that you don't benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, feel free to use <Item id="24618"/> and adjust your gear with the Optimizer.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Trait name="heavylight" size="big" disableText/> | Can be used when phase times are very short, as the time casting <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> can become too predominant and occasionally prevents you from casting impactful abilities in time. It's particularly good on bosses such as MAMA. It can also be used on Arkk, Artsariiv and Ensolyss. Overall, it makes the rotation easier, however <Trait name="biggamehunter"/> remains a stronger trait on most encounters (Skorvald, Artsariiv, Siax, Ensolyss and even Arkk although the difference is minimal). |

### Virtues

<Traits traits1Id="46" traits1="Virtues" traits1SelectedIds="624,603,622" />

If you can reliably upkeep <Boon name="Aegis"/>, you can drop the **Radiance** trait line for Virtues for more personal damage. Please note you will need to adjust your gear to crit cap! Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu) for more gear variants!

It is very important to maintain <Boon name="Resolution"/> for <Trait name="righteousinstincts" /> and <Trait name="retribution"/>. <Trait name="healersresolution"/> causes your heal skill to apply ~10s of <Boon name="Resolution" />, and <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> provides ~6s of <Boon name="Resolution" />.

- When beginning phases after splits (e.g. Ensolyss), you likely will not have <Boon name="Resolution" />. Make sure to precast <Skill name="litanyofwrath" /> at the start of these phases so that you have <Boon name="Resolution" /> during your opener. This is especially important when beginning phases on Longbow as you will not have <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> up until late in your burst.

It may require some attention to maintain permanent <Boon name="Resolution" /> solo. Notable teammates who can aid with <Boon name="Resolution" /> uptime include:

- <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Firebrands" />, if taking
  - <Skill name="mantraofsolace" />
  - <Skill name="mantraofliberation" />
  - <Skill name="standyourground" />

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>
<Information>

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.\
For that reason, you will find some general notes for skill usage here.
</Information>
<Grid>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="7">

### Standard Opener

**Rotation:**

1.  <Skill name="Sword of Justice" profession="guardian"/>
2.  <Skill name="Procession of Blades " profession="guardian"/>
3.  <Skill name="spearofjustice" profession="guardian"/>
4.  <Skill name="Symbol of Energy" profession="guardian"/>
5.  <Skill name="Hunter's Ward" profession="guardian"/>
6.  <Skill name="True Shot" profession="guardian"/>
7.  **Weapon Swap**
8.  <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution" profession="guardian"/>
9.  <Skill name="Whirling Wrath" profession="guardian"/>
10. <Skill name="leapoffaith" />
11. <Skill name="bindingblade" />

Remember to add CC skills for breakbars, and to save <Skill name="bindingblade" /> if there are multi-hit opportunities. After the opener, improvise according to phase timings.

<Card title="Notes on skill usage:">

- Cast <Skill name="whirlingwrath"/> inside the boss' hitbox so the additional projectiles hit.
- Cancel your <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and <Skill name="bindingblade" /> aftercasts to save time.
- Cast <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the boss' hitbox to multi-hit when adds are present. This is most common at **Siax** and **Ensolyss**, but also occurs at **Artsariiv**, **Arkk**, and **MAMA**.
- If running <Trait name="biggamehunter" /> and precasting traps, symbols, or <Skill name="firestorm"/>, open with <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> as soon as the boss is vulnerable.

<Beginner>

### Step-by-Step Rotation
**Step 1: Sword of Justice + Trap**

Start with <Skill name="swordofjustice"/> and <Skill name="processionofblades" />.

- <Skill name="swordofjustice" profession="guardian" /> and <Skill name="processionofblades" /> both have a wind up time before dealing all their damage. Use them at the start of your opener to maximize your burst.
- <Skill name="swordofjustice" profession="guardian" /> has 3 charges. The other charges can be used later in the rotation as filler.

**Step 2: Longbow skills**

Next, use <Skill name="symbolofenergy" /> (LB4), <Skill name="huntersward" /> (LB5), and <Skill name="trueshot" /> (LB2).

- <Skill name="huntersward" /> is easy to cancel by queuing your next skill too early. Be careful not to cancel it with <Skill name="trueshot" />.
- <Skill name="deflectingshot" /> (LB3) is a CC skill. Use it to deal breakbar damage to bosses or when knockback is needed.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>

**Step 3: Greatsword Skills**

From here on, cast <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> (GS4) and <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> (GS2) off-cooldown.

- <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/> has a very long aftercast which can be cancelled to save time. This can be done by moving or stowing weapon after the symbol is placed.
- <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/> fires additional damaging projectiles outwards. Try to stand inside the boss' hitbox so that these projectiles don't miss.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>

**Step 4: Additional Greatsword Skills**

<Skill name="bindingblade" /> (GS5) and <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> (GS3) can add additional damage or utility depending on the context.

- <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> fires projectiles at up to 5 nearby enemies. The skill can be recast to pull in hit enemies, or to deal breakbar damage to bosses.
- If standing inside a boss' hitbox, additional projectiles from <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> will all hit the boss, dealing massive single-target damage.
- <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> can be saved for mobility in fights with movement.
- If no above situations apply, <Skill name="bindingblade" /> and <Skill name="leapoffaith" /> provide a moderate dps increase over autoattacking. Weave them in after <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and <Skill name="whirlingwrath" />.

The opener should now look like this:

1. <Skill name="Sword of Justice"/>
2. <Skill name="Procession of Blades"/>
3. <Skill name="Symbol of Energy"/>
4. <Skill name="Hunter's Ward"/>
5. <Skill name="True Shot"/>
6. Swap to Greatsword
7. <Skill name="Symbol of Resolution"/>
8. <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>
9. <Skill name="leapoffaith" />
10. <Skill name="bindingblade" />

### Precasting

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use these skills for precasts:

1.  Cast <Skill name="litany of wrath"/> for <Boon name="Resolution"/>
2.  Use <Skill name="Save yourselves"/> and <Skill name="hallowedground"/> (<Skill name="hallowedground"/> is a must)
3.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>
4.  Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>
5.  Take the Mistlock Singularity
6.  Blast a fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> again

- Add <Skill name="shieldofcourage" /> if the team would benefit from precasted <Boon name="Aegis" />. Be wary of <Instability name="Vengeance"/> converting this to <Condition name="Weakness" />!

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you will have the general concept down. Additional tips can be found on the advanced page if you wish to improve further.

For now, try to:

- Employ weapon swap in fights with long phases, usually after using <Skill name="Whirling Wrath"/>/<Skill name="True Shot"/> twice on their respective weapon sets.
- Make use of your CC skills to break boss bars faster
- Start thinking about phase times and how to fit the maximum amount of damage in before the boss dies/goes invulnerable

<Divider text="Underwater combat"/>

It is very much recommended to play <BuildLink build="Condi Firebrand" specialization="Firebrand"/> since it provides much better DPS underwater compared to <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/>. If you still want to play <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> for whatever reason follow these rough guidelines.

- Open with <Skill name="refraction"/> for <Boon name="resolution"/>
- Cast <Skill name="purify"/> and swap to spear. Camp spear now.
- Priority list:
  1.  <Skill name="Zealots flurry"/> (Spear 2)
  2.  <Skill name="Symbol of spears"/> (Spear 4)
  3.  <Skill name="brilliance"/> (Spear 3)

<Divider text="Advanced Tips"/>

<Warning> 
The following tips are heavily tailored to static groups looking to push their damage, and are not recommended for pug scenarios. 
</Warning>

- Try to use <Skill name="bindingblade"/> inside the boss' hitbox when multiple adds are nearby, as it will proc for every for surrounding you within a 600 range.
- <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> can be used to cancel aftercasts as it has priority over other abilities. It is useful to cancel <Skill name="bindingblade"/>'s aftercast on Artsariiv P1.
- <Skill name="dragonsmaw"/> cast on the edge of the boss will also periodically apply 150 Defiance-bar damage from pulling thanks to the field left in its wake. This can be used on multiple encounters.
- Sheathing: multiple abilities can be sheathed/stowed for significant damage increases: <Skill name="symbolofresolution"/>, <Skill name="bindingblade"/> and <Skill name="zealotsdefense"/>. Casting <Skill name="vengefulstrike"/> and following with a different ability than <Skill name="wrathfulstrike"/> needs to be avoided as <Skill name="vengefulstrike"/> in itself has a huge aftercast, which cannot be interrupted by stowing.
- Traps can be precasted on the edge of MAMA and Ensolyss' locations, and will proc when they both use their signature ability: the bubble. This is because both of them reposition slightly while casting it. Said location for traps to proc is quite forgiving on MAMA, but rather difficult to find on Ensolyss and takes some getting used to: both are pretty consistent.
- Additionally, traps can be cast on the edge of Arkk's hitbox during downtime, namely <Skill name="processionofblades"/>, to be later proced after pushing the orbs. Traps have a tendency to proc when any moving and damaging field collides with the enemy's hitbox, such as Scrapper gyros, Mallyx elite ability and Warrior's Torch#5. To achieve this, picture the diagonals passing through Arkk and the central tiles. Cast <Skill name="processionofblades"/> on one of those diagonals such that the trap overlaps Arkk's hitbox, but doesn't cover it completely. This is useful on Arkk as <Skill name="processionofblades"/> has a rather short cooldown, and the boss has a lot of downtime.

### Trap Precasting

Before precasting boons at the Mistlock Singularity, you can precast traps on the boss or at add spawn locations for additional damage.

- You may want to skip <Skill name="purification" /> so that you can precast <Trait name="healersresolution" /> at the mistlock.
- If you status reset yourself (i.e. swap to a template with different traits), all of your traps (plus boons/buffs) will disappear.
- If <Skill name="processionofblades" /> or <Skill name="lightsjudgment" /> are swapped off of your utility bar, they will disappear even without status reset.

### Symbol Precasting

Right before the boss is triggered, cast multiple symbols by cycling through weapons in your inventory. These will tick on the boss for additional burst damage.

The available symbols for precasting are as follows: <Skill name="symboloffaith" />, <Skill name="symbolofswiftness" />, <Skill name="symbolofpunishment" />, <Skill name="symbolofblades" />, <Skill name="symbolofenergy" />, <Skill name="symbolofresolution" />.

- <Skill name="symboloffaith" /> has the longest cast time and drops at your location at the end of the cast, so it is recommended to start with this while running in.
- Add <Skill name="shieldofwrath" /> in towards the end of your symbols for significant extra damage. This may be difficult to do without a dedicated equipment template as equipping a 2-handed weapon will unequip your Focus.
- It is important to trigger the boss right after you finish using your symbols, or you will lose damage ticks on your symbols.
- Instant CC is valuable so that symbols tick into <Effect name="Exposed" />.
- In fast phase times, it can be worth it to use <Skill name="symbolofresolution" /> and/or <Skill name="symbolofenergy" /> in your precast. With slower phases, it may be better to use them in-phase so that no ticks are missed.

Here is a symbol precast example skill order:

1. <Skill name="symboloffaith" /> while running in
2. <Skill name="symbolofswiftness" />
3. <Skill name="symbolofpunishment" /> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath" />
4. Swap to main weapon and trigger boss

You may wish to add/remove symbols to your precast depending on personal speed or boon/buff timers (such as <Skill name="onewolfpack" />). Do note that it is not worth casting 6 symbols as your oldest symbol will have expired by the time the boss is vulnerable.

- It can be useful to create dedicated templates for symbol and trap precasting. Take care not to status reset by swapping between build templates with different traits - only different utilities are okay.
- Do not precast symbols in pugs, unless you are absolutely sure no one else will trigger the boss before you, or you will have to learn the hard way and play Mace <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" />.

**Ideal Symbol Precasts**: priority is Scepter→Sword+Focus→Staff→Longbow. Always have Scepter and Focus equipped over the weapon you would usually start the encounter with. If you prefer to have Mace as an extra weapon through this process, to get in the flow, it must always come first, and can be cast as you traverse a portal to the boss. When on Scepter, cast <Skill name="symbolofpunishment"/>. As it goes off, switch to Sword and use <Skill name="symbolofblades"/> & <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/>. then Staff (<Skill name="symbolofswiftness"/>), Longbow (<Skill name="symbolofenergy"/>), and finally your weapon of choice for the start of the encounter (Greatsword + <Skill name="symbolofresolution"/> or current Longbow).

If you do not wish to use multiple templates just for symbol precasting:

- In the inventory, position the weapons you need in a straight line or in a square shape at the very top of it; find something practical for you, for frequent use. Make sure you have an empty slot for the focus as well, so it always drops down in the right place every time you equip and unequip it. _The use of Ascended weapons is an absolute must_. _Current_ weapon strength does matter when casting abilities. **Do NOT share any ascended weapons between templates**. Make sure to have unique ascended weapons for each template you might need.
