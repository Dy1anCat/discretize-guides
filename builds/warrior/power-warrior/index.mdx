<Tab specialization="Warrior" title="Build">

The <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="Warrior"/> is the support build for warriors in fractals. It provides a lot less DPS compared to <Specialization name="Berserker"/>. In PuGs however, where CC or <Boon name="Might"/> is the limiting factor it can be beneficial to bring <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="Warrior"/> over <Specialization name="Berserker"/>.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs (<Skill id="14405"/>, <Skill id="14407"/> and <Trait id="1482"/>) and having excellent defiance bar damage with the Mace/Mace set, the build also has a medium burst damage potential on both small and large hitboxes for a support role.

If enemy boons are present and for some reason you are still not playing the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> + <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> composition, the <Specialization name="Spellbreaker"/> specialization can be played to reliably remove boons with <Skill id="45252"/> and <Trait id="2162"/>. Another advantage of this variation is the strong on-demand projectile destruction with <Skill id="45333"/>.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item id="24868"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/>. As a support warrior, your focus is first and foremost providing the group with aforementioned damage buffs and removing boons, secondly breaking the defiance bar while following your optimized damage rotation.

If you're running without a <Specialization name="Druid"/> or <Specialization name="Renegade"/> (for whatever unlogical reason), you need to provide <Boon name="Might"/> (and <Boon name="Fury"/> to some degree) for the party. This is achieved with the following changes to the build:

- 6x <Item name="Strength" type="Rune"/> instead of <Item name="Scholar" type="Rune"/>
- <Item name="Fried Golden Dumpling" type="Food"/> instead of <Item id="41569"/>
- <Skill name="For Great Justice"/> instead of <Skill id="14502"/>

Everything else stays the same.

<Card title="Skill usage">

- Pre-fight:
  - Use <Skill id="14394"/> and <Skill id="14393"/> on warhorn (<Boon name="Vigor" disableText/><Boon name="Swiftness" disableText/>) to blast a fire field for <Boon name="Might"/>.
  - Place <Skill id="14407"/> and <Skill id="14405"/> into to the boss
  - Use <Skill id="14402"/> to charge up Adrenaline immediately before the fight starts
- Breaking defiance bars:
  - If there is a defiance bar present immediately at the start of the fight, start on your Mace/Mace set - otherwise swap to it when necessary
  - With <Item id="24639"/>, you will deal over 940 defiance bar damage with the following skill order:
    - <Skill id="14415"/>, you can precast it and cancel the aftercast animation
    - <Skill id="14503"/>
    - <Skill id="14414"/>
    - <Skill id="14502"/>
  - This also grants 1-3 stacks of <Trait id="1437"/>, <Item id="84505"/> and <Trait id="1444"/>
- DPS:
  - Camp Axe/Axe if there is no CC needed
  - Damage modifiers:
    - Make sure to use <Skill id="14353"/> when you are at full adrenaline to gain three stacks of <Trait id="1437"/>
    - Trigger <Trait id="1444"/> by using <Skill id="14502"/>. Adds 20% damage but keep in mind that it does not stack
  - Use <Skill id="14399"/> while all modifiers are up
  - Use <Skill id="14421"/>, <Skill id="14398"/> and <Skill id="14418"/> off recharge
  - Don't cancel the third hit of your auto-attack chain as it does more damage than the first two combined
- Keep in mind that <Skill id="14518"/> inflicts 15x <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> if your party is running low on it

If the Mistlock Singularity is easily accessible and close to the encounter:

- for very short encounters (< 50 seconds) pre cast <Skill id="14407"/> <Skill id="14405"/> <Skill id="14408"/> or <Skill id="14528"/> and <Skill id="14419"/> and use <Skill id="14516"/> and <Skill id="14410"/> instead of the usual <Skill id="14407"/> and <Skill id="14405"/>. Activate <Skill id="14410"/> during burst phase (e.g. right before using <Skill id="14399"/>)
- for longer encounters (>50 seconds) use e.g. <Skill id="12363"/> before picking up the Mistlock Singularity

Several Warrior skills involving movement and or leaps such as <Skill id="14446"/>, <Skill id="14447"/> <Skill id="45252"/> <Skill id="46233"/> <Skill id="14424"/> <Skill id="14502"/> and <Skill id="14366"/> cannot be canceled by stow/draw weapons but by using weapon swap.

With enemy boons present (<Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, Swampland, Molten Boss, Twilight Oasis) and no <Specialization text="Domination Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> or <Specialization text="Mallyx Renegade" name="Renegade"/> you will have to take the <Specialization name="Spellbreaker"/> specialization instead of **Discipline**.

You should also take <Skill id="45333"/> where necessary. You can consider <Item id="72872"/> for additional party <Boon name="Might"/>.

Gear-wise you are losing Power, Precision, and Ferocity from Discipline's trait <Trait id="1484"/>. To make up for this we are recommending to use our [Gear-optimiser](http://old.discretize.eu) on the website if you want to max out crit cap.

Everything else stays the same.

<Card title="Spellbreaker variant">

- Evolve your rotation around your highest burst damage skills: <Skill id="14399"/> and <Skill id="14554"/>
  - Before using high burst damage skills:
    - Trigger <Trait id="1444"/> by using <Skill id="14502"/>. Adds 20% damage but keep in mind that it does not stack.
    - Have 1-3 stacks of <Trait id="1437"/>. Remember that <Skill id="44165"/> counts as a burst skill. Each stack adds another 7% up to 21% total (with 3 stacks).
    - Trigger <Trait id="2060"/> which goes hand in hand with <Trait id="1437"/> and adds another 10% damage
    - Have 1-5 stacks of <Trait id="2130"/> adding 45 Power and Ferocity per stack
  - On **Greatsword**:
    - Don't cancel your auto-attack as the third hit deals the most damage
    - <Skill id="14447"/> is a DPS increase, especially against a wall
    - <Skill id="14510"/> is worth using between auto-attack chains
  - On **Dagger/Axe**:
    - Use <Skill id="44937"/> preferably while the target is using a skill
    - <Skill id="14418"/> is a DPS increase
  - Use <Skill id="45333"/> when there are multiple targets with boons (e.g. MAMA and Assault Knight at 25%), you are not at the target to remove boons in time (e.g. Artsariiv after the split 66% and 33%) or to destroy projectiles (e.g. Imbued Shaman initial Lava Elemental spawn at 75% and final 25%)
- **Full Counter** (to trigger <Trait id="1437"/>):
  - <Skill id="44165"/> block aspect acts similar to <Boon name="Aegis"/>. Thus any attack you would be able to block with <Boon name="Aegis"/> successfully activates <Skill id="44165"/>.
