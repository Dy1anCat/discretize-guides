The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is a strong build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals. It has excellent defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has medium burst and excellent sustained damage. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>. The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> excels at fighting larger groups of mobs due to extreme cleave with greatswords <Skill name="arcdivider" /> -> <Skill name="bloodreckoning" /> -> <Skill name="arcdivider" /> combo.

Unfortunately, this builds requires a lot of Assassin pieces or other runes than <Item name="scholar" /> due to receiving very little <Attribute name="Precision" /> from traits. This is also the reason why the <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher <Attribute name="Agony Resistance" />.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

<Beginner>

Before progressing to the advanced version of this page, we recommend acquiring an in-depth understanding of your CC skills and when to use them efficiently. You should be able to hit consistently high DPS, which you can verify with [arc-dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). And finally, you should be able to execute the basic step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it.

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Warrior"/> has to offer. If you ever feel like you are missing information feel free to already swap to the advanced page!

<Information>

Although this build lists 162 <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, it is not a strict requirement! We recommend getting started with this build anyway - even if it might be suboptimal while being in Tier 1 or 2 fractals. Keep upgrading your <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> until you reach the suggested variant. In the beginning, it is much more important to learn about fractal mechanics and your skills rather than equipping optimal gear.

**How to deal damage:**

- Use <Skill name="decapitate"/> as often as possible. Three crits are required to gain a single <Skill name="decapitate"/>:
  1.  <Skill name="Cycloneaxe" /> and <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior" />.
  2.  <Skill name="Dualstrike" /> and <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior" />.
  3.  <Skill name="whirlingaxe" />.
- Get three <Skill name="decapitate"/> before pressing <Skill name="Whirling axe"/>.
- If the boss has a breakbar, make sure to use <Skill name="Tremor"/> to proc <Item name="severance"/>, then swap to Axe/Axe.

<Advanced>

- Only use <Skill name="Throw axe" profession="warrior"/> outside <Skill name="Berserk"/> to prevent its ammo count fully recharging.
- Interrupting your auto-attack chain to use <Skill name="Decapitate"/> or enter <Skill name="Berserk"/> is a DPS increase.
- Keep in mind that <Skill name="Crushing Blow"/> inflicts <Condition name="Vulnerability" count={10}/>! This can be often used with no DPS loss if you are on your mace set waiting to CC. Especially useful if you apply the <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> to adds for a quick burst. If the foe is disabled it even inflicts <Condition name="Vulnerability" count={20} />
- You must be in <Skill name="Berserk"/> mode for as many burn phases as possible for maximum DPS. Pay attention to your group's phase times and your <Skill name="Berserk"/> extensions. It is better for <Skill name="Berserk"/> to drop when the boss isnâ€™t <Effect name="Exposed"/> if that means it will be back up right before another burst window.
- Think ahead when CC is needed and swap to Maces earlier to avoid losing invaluable <Skill name="Berserk"/> time.

</Advanced>

**Extra notes:**

- If your groups <Boon name="Might"/> is not 25, take <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>. It is a bigger DPS increase than <Skill name="signetofmight"/>!
- If you expect your party to be slow it can make sense to bring <Trait name="smashbrawler"/> and eat the initial <Control name="Stun"/> of <Skill name="headbutt"/>.
- Casting <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> is only a DPS gain if you canâ€™t be hitting something else, use it right before the start of DPS phases but only use it during if you need the heal.
- Entering <Skill name="Berserk"/> grants three stacks of <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/>, while <Skill name="Decapitate"/> only grants one. You will find <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/> starting to run low when out of <Skill name="Berserk"/>. Try to make sure you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> for burn phases while also not delaying <Skill name="Berserk"/> where possible.

**When to take Mace:**

- In fights with only one defiance bar, in the beginning, use Axe/Mace.
- In T4s and encounters that have defiance bars during the fight, use an offhand mace only.

<Card title="Information">

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  
For that reason, you find suggestions for pressing your axe skills in different estimated phase lengths here.
