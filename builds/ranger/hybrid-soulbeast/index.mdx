<Warning>

This build is strong in [Sunqua Peak CM](/fractals/sunqua-peak/) and Silent Surf CM. In power groups and other bosses this build will perform very poorly compared to <BuildLink specialization="Soulbeast" build="Power Soulbeast"/> - the power damage counterpart.

</Warning>

<Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Hybrid Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high sustained damage but not much utility. This build is intended to be used **only** for 99 and 100 CMs. For most other fractals, especially if your group is playing power builds, you will be better off playing the power variant found [here](/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast/).

This build has a relatively unforgiving rotation and can be awkward to play in pugs due to a lack of CC. However, <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Hybrid Soulbeast"/> is one of the highest damage builds on 99 and 100CM when played correctly.

This build uses the Jade Bot Core: Tier 10 in combination with 9 <Item name="Malign +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 9 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/>. However you can also run 15 <Item name="Malign +9 Agony Infusion"/> and 3 <Item name="Spiteful +9 Agony Infusion"/> with <Item id="91876"/>, giving you the same stats.

If you need to drop a utility skill <Skill name="Sic Em"/> should be replaced.

If healing isn't an issue, <Item name="writofmasterfulmalice"/> provides a slight dps increase over <Item name="toxicfocusingcrystal"/>.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

The main idea behind the rotation is to use your high damage skills under the effects of <Skill name="Sic Em"/>. The rest of your utility skills can be used as soon as they are available. 

Where possible, do not intterupt your auto attack chain. This is because the later attacks in the chain apply stacks of <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and <Condition name="Poisoned"/>. 

<Skill name="Primal Cry"/> can be used when you have no other skills availible, instead of an auto attack chain.

### Elemental Ai Opener 
Use while Ai is still in mid:
1. <Skill name="Winter's Bite"/>
2. <Skill name="Splitblade"/>
3. <Skill name="Rain of Spikes"/>
4. <Skill name="Primal Cry"/>
5. <Skill name="Throw Torch"/>

<Card title="Precasting">

This build will not perform well outside of 99 and 100 CMs so this precasting section will be focused on precasts for those fractals.

#### **Skills**

**<Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/> -** Used for some additional <Condition name="Bleeding"/> at the start of the fight. Lasts 30 seconds. Is not wiped when the fight starts on 99/100CM. If you use a second time while you still have charges left, the original charges will be overwritten.

**<Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> -** Used for some additional <Condition name="Bleeding"/> at the start of the fight. Lasts 30 seconds. Is not wiped when the fight starts on 99/100CM. This stacks in intensity so you can use the skill after taking the mistlock giving you 10 stacks of <Condition name="Bleeding"/>.

**<Skill name="Double Arc"/> -** Can be precasted giving you the effect _Poisonous Strike_ lasting for 7 seconds. When you have this effect and are merged your next 2 attacks will inflict 1 stack of <Condition name="poisoned" text ="Poison"/> lasting for 6 seconds. This skill can be used twice giving you 3 charges. The effect is not wiped when the fight starts on 99/100CM.

**<Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> -** Can be precasted giving you the effect _Bloodthirst_ lasting for 12 seconds. When you have this effect and are merged your next 3 attacks will inflict 1 stack of <Condition name="bleeding" text ="Bleed"/>. The effect is not wiped when the fight starts on 99/100CM.

**<Skill name="Sic 'Em"/> -** Can be cast if the boss is triggered without starting the fight, allowing it to be targeted. The effect is not wiped. This allows you to delay your first **<Skill name="Sic 'Em"/>** to when the boss charges to the first wall. NOTE: this will cause any pets to immediately aggro to the boss. Should only be used if portalling from mistlock to the boss.

The elite stance **<Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>** is removed upon entering combat on 99CM. Using an elite that summons friendly pets is your best precast in this slot. **<Skill name="Mistfire Wolf"/>**, **<Skill name="Hounds of Balthazar"/>**, and **<Skill name="Summon Sylvan Hound"/>** are options that can synergize well if you have a <Specialization name="Thief"/> who can precast venoms onto the pets.
