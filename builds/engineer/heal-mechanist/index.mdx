<Warning>
 
This build is very common in PuGs. It is currently the best heal build to use in PuGs. More info about this can be found [here](/guides/teamcomp101/). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It, therefore, shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. 

</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Alacrity Mechanist" /> provides permanent <Boon name="Might" />, <Boon name="Alacrity" />, <Boon name="Fury" />, <Boon name="Regeneration" /> and <Boon name="Vigor" />, as well as some <Boon name="Protection" />. It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> through <Skill id="63293"/>.

It offers a large of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>. Whenever you use a Jade Golem skill it pumps out more healing when traited with <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>. You can also provide a huge amount of <Effect name="barrier"/> with <Skill id="63141"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> maintaing a near permanant uptime on your party.

Due to your Mech not inheriting any <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> modifiers or converted stats, such as the <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> to <Attribute name="Concentration"/> conversion from the <Item id="75427"/> with the Fractal Attunement masteries, it makes sense to use the raid setup found on [Snow Crows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/engineer/mechanist/heal-alacrity-mechanist). You can check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants, but be mindful you have enough <Attribute name="Concentration"/> to maintain boons!

</GridItem>
</Grid>

### Kits

A large part of the support is generated through the use of your Jade Mech and Kits.

Engineering kits can be opened instantly to give access to 5 new skills, which when closed again return you to your weapon set. Each kit skill will have its separate cooldown, although as you play the class you come to get a feel for when each skill will be available.

<Skill name="Crash Down" text="Jade Mech" size="medium"/>:

Your jade mech is your main source of <Boon name="Alacrity"/> generation, while also providing a significant portion of your other boons. It inherits your concentration and healing power thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.

- <Skill id="63365"/> and your Mechs auto attacks will slowly generate a small amount of might thanks to <Trait name="Mech Arms: High-Impact Drivers"/>.
- <Skill id="63293"/> grants <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Boon name="Aegis"/> to 5 targets. It also is a condition cleanse and a stun break.
- <Skill id="63141"/> pulses <Boon name="Might"/> abd <Boon name="Fury"/> to 5 targets resulting in 30 seconds of <Boon name="Might" text="15 Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> being shared. It also generates a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> which in turn generates <Boon name="Alacrity"/> thanks to <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>.
- You can summon your Mech using <Skill name="Crash Down"/> and recall it with <Skill name="Recall Mech"/>
- Sometimes your Mech can get stuck, you can try to use _Return to Me_ to get it to come to you, if this doesn't work you may have to recall it instead. Alternatively if <Skill name="Shift Signet"/> is availible, this can be used to port your Mech to your target.
- Remember your Mech commands will generate boons in a radius around your Mech. Make sure it is in range of you and your party before using them!

<Skill name="Med Kit" size="medium"/>:

Your Med Kit is your main source of healing. It has a mixture of condi cleanse, supportive boon generation, and burst healing thanks to <Trait name="Health Insurance"/>

- <Skill name="Med Blaster"/> and <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> provide a large amount of constant healing to your party.
- <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> will cleanse up to 4 conditions over 3 seconds, while also providing a water field that can be used for blast heals.
- <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> is a large group heal that should be used to recover from high incoming damage.
- <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> is a blast finisher that can be used to blast your water field from <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> for burst healing. It also provides some <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Vigor"/> and <Boon name="Swiftness"/>.
- Remember that many skills in <Skill name="Med Kit"/> heal in a small radius so make sure you are close to your party.

<Skill name="Elixir Gun" size="medium"/>:

Provides some additional support through condi cleanse, some burst healing, and slow CC.

- <Skill name="Tranquilizer Dart"/> applies <Condition name="Weakness"/> for some slow CC.
- <Skill name="Glob Shot"/> applies <Condition name="Crippled"/> for some slow CC. When hitting an enemy it will also share <Boon name="Swiftness"/> to allies.
- <Skill name="Fumigate"/> is a mass condi cleanse, cleansing up to 5 conditions from allies. It also applies a small amount of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.
- <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/> is a blast finisher. Also since it is an Elixir it grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> is a burst heal, Once hit it also creates an area of continual healing for 10 seconds, making this one of your best healing abilities. It also condi-cleanses and grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>
- While not every skill in this kit is commonly used, in particular, the condi cleanse and burst heal are very useful in high-pressure situations.

<Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit" size="medium"/>:

While not every skill is commonly used, it still provides some slow CC and has access to a strong AoE pulsing heal.

- <Skill name="Endothermic Shell"/> applies a large amount of slow CC through <Condition name="Chilled"/>.
- <Skill name="Flash Shell"/> applies some slow cc through <Condition name="Blinded"/>.
- <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> is a strong AoE pulsing heal that can be used proactively before high pressure situations. It also grants <Boon name="might"/> through <Trait name="HGH"/>.

<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
#### Standard Boons

- <Boon name="Alacrity"/> is applied by two methods. The first is <Skill id="63293"/>, which should be pressed off cooldown. In addition to this through the trait <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>, when you apply <Effect name="Barrier"/> you will also share <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. With high <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> it is very easy to upkeep 100% duration.
- <Boon name="Might"/> is mainly generated from <Skill id="63141"/>, which will allow you to easily maintain 15 stacks. Outside of this you slowly generate <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Trait name="HGH"/>, which slowly will ramp might up to 25 stacks over time. If <Boon name="Might"/> is really suffering, you can also use utility skills such as <Skill name="Flame Turret"/> along with <Trait name="Experimental Turrets"/> to help.
- <Boon name="Fury" /> will be provided through pressing <Skill id="63141"/> off cooldown. As long as you have at least 62.5% <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> you will be able to maintain 100% uptime.
- <Boon name="Swiftness"/> is provided mainly through <Skill name="Glob Shot"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Boon name="Regeneration"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/> off cooldown. When using <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, you also share it when using <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Boon name="Protection"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill id="63293"/> off cooldown. Additionally using you Shield skills will also share some through <Trait name="Over SHield"/>.
- <Boon name="Stability"/> is lacking on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/>, with <Skill id="63293"/> providing 1 stack on a 24 second cooldown (with <Boon name="Alacrity"/>).
- <Boon name="Aegis"/> is lacking on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/>, with <Skill id="63293"/> providing 1 stack on a 24 second cooldown (with <Boon name="Alacrity"/>).
- <Boon name="Vigor"/> can be maintained permanantly by using <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/> off cooldown. When using <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, you also share it when using <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- <Effect name="Barrier"/> helps to provide <Boon name="Alacrity"/> through the trait <Trait name="Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits"/>, while providing excellent damage mitigation. You have 3 main methods of generating <Effect name="Barrier"/>; <Trait name="Mech Core: Barrier Engine"/> passivley generates it over time, Your utility skills <Skill id="63141"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> and finally by using <Skill name="Barrier Blast" /> Your third auto attack skill on Mace.

</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
<Card title="Pre-Stacking Boons">

- To provide most of your boons, you can simiply cast <Skill id="63293"/>, <Skill id="63141"/> and <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>.
- If there is no fire field you can provide one with <Skill name="Napalm"/> (Skill 4) in <Skill name="Flamethrower"/>.
- To blast your firefield to share <Boon name="Might"/>, <Specialization name="Engineer"/> has blast finishers on many of its skills. Your most acessible blasts on <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Mechanist"/> are:
  - <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/> in <Skill name="Elixir Gun"/>
  - <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> in <Skill name="Med Kit"/>
  - if you used <Skill name="Flamethrower"/> to provide a firefield, <Skill name="Flame Blast"/>
  - <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/>, the second activation of Shield 4.

<Divider text="Healing"/>

### Sustained Healing

- A large amount of your sustsined healing comes from traits. <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>, <Trait name="Compounding Chemicals"/> and <Trait name="Backpack Regenerator"/> generate a lot of passive healing to yourself, which is then shared with <Trait name="Medical Dispersion Field"/> and amplified with <Trait name="Health Insurance"/>.
- When under constant pressure <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> and <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> can be used. It is reccomended to use <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> first due to its shorter cooldwon.
- If your parties hp is not full you can use <Skill name="Med Blaster"/> in <Skill name="Med Kit"/> which is very strong. However, you should first consider other abilities to heal your party quicker since you want to maximize your time on mace to generate <Effect name="Barrier"/>.
- Your best form of sustained healing is to keep your <Effect name="Barrier"/> uptime high. By using  <Skill id="63141"/> and <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/>, your party will not lose much health due to tanking damage.

### Burst Healing

- <Skill name="Vital Burst"/> and <Skill name="Bandage Blast"/> can be used for some burst healing.
- Aditionally you have 2 water fields with <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> and <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> which can then be blasted with <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/>, <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/> and <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/> for massive healing.
- If you don't have any burst healing abilities up, you can use <Skill name="Barrier Signet"/> for a large amount of <Effect name="Barrier"/> to help sustain your party while you heal them back up.
- If you are anticipating a large amount of incoming damage using <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> or <Skill name="Elixir Shell"/> before for strong healing over time can be useful.

### Condition Cleanse

- Your strongest condition cleanse is <Skill name="Fumigate"/> in <Skill name="Elixir Gun"/>, removing up to 5 conditions on 5 targets.
- Blasting Light Fields also causes area condition cleanse. You can place light fields with <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> or <Skill name="Flash Shell"/> and then blast with <Skill name="Acid Bomb"/>, <Skill name="Magnetic Inversion"/> or <Skill name="Infusion Bomb"/>.
- If you have a high amount of condition pressure you can use <Skill name="Cleansing Field"/> or <Skill name="Super Elixir"/> for a longer-lasting condition cleanse over time.

<Warning>
Remember to equip a <Item id="24842"/> to your Aquabreather, so you will get the 6th bonus underwater!
</Warning>

When underwater, <Specialization name="Mechanist" text="Heal Alacrity Mechanist"/> is unplayable due to your <Skill name="Crash Down" text="Jade Mech"/> skills not being availible, which leaves you with a couple of options. You can either swap class to a <Boon name="Alacrity"/> provider that will work underwater (<Specialization name="Renegade"/> or <Specialization name="Tempest"/>). Alternatively, if you want to stay as an <Specialization name="Engineer"/> your best option is to swap to <Specialization name="Scrapper" text="Heal Quickness Scrapper"/>.
