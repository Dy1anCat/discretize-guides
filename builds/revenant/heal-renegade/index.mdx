The **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>** plays with a mix of harrier's and cleric's gear for maximum power and healing power while still hitting 100% boon duration.

Since the damage and life steals of <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit" /> are based on the **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>**'s own power and healing power, the <Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/> aims to maximize those stats.

Feel free to run full Harrier if you are confident that you don't need the extra healing power or toughness from cleric. The more agony resistance you have, the more cleric you can afford to run and still hit 100% boon duration.

<Card title="Second trait variant">
If you run out of energy too quickly, we recommend the Salvation/Invocation variant. This variant is also better for fractals where <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/> doesn't help your party. This would include fractals where damage is time-gated and where you can't critically hit the enemies that matter.

You should consider running this trait variant in fractals like Molten Furnace and Captain Mai Trin.

<Card title="Healing Basics">
Your healing skills in order of effectiveness are:

1. <Skill id="45773"/>
2. <Skill id="45686"/>
3. <Skill id="27025"/>
4. <Trait id="1815"/>
5. <Skill id="27356"/>
6. <Skill id="29002"/>
7. <Skill id="28427"/>

With <Skill id="45773"/> you can sustain your group for the whole time you have energy on <Skill id="41858"/>. When you are about to swap off, you should use your <Skill id="45686"/> on the group as it lingers even when you swap to a different legend and will maintain the heals. <Skill id="28195"/> has a good proactive way to lessen the incoming damage by proper usage of <Skill id="26821"/>. You also have heals when you use your basic staff auto attack <Skill id="29002"/> (note that this is the last part of the auto attack sequence).

<Card title="Legends">

<Information>

You will need to reconsider the legends you are running in almost every fractal and therefore it is a nice habit to develop to check them after each fractal you have done. Some fractals demand three to four different legends in only one fractal. Below you will find the three most common setups that will serve you fine as well as a description of the skills in each legend.

</Information>

## Legends Setups:

1. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>**
   - This is your most used setup that has the most healing output as well as a projectile block and extra condition cleanse.
2. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>**
   - This is a specific setup for the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and for when you want to increase your damage output on bosses that generate <Boon name="Protection"/> on themselves or when you need to pull adds using <Skill name="Call to Anguish"/>.
3. **<Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>** and **<Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>**
   - This is the setup you want to use on a few CM bosses (Skorvald and Artsariiv) as well as some fractals (Chaos last boss, possibly in Siren's Reef).
