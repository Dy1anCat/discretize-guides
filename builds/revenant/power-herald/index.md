The Power Quickness <Specialization name="Herald"/> provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Swiftness"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, ~13 <Boon name="Might"/>, additional incoming boon duration, and good CC with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/>.

This particular build is far more utility focussed compared to the [<Specialization name="Renegade" disableText/>    Power Alac Renegade Build](/builds/revenant/power-renegade/). In general other stances are recommended over <Skill name="Legendary Assassin Stance" />. Below we will cover both examples of stances and when they are used.
