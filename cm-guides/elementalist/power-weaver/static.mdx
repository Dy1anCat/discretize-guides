<Warning>

This build only works if you kill MAMA in less than 55 seconds. If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version. The following guide assumes you are following the proposed [CC-Distribution](/guides/cc-distribution).
</Warning>

In more organised groups it's recommended to run <Specialization name="Tempest"/>+<Skill name="conjurelightninghammer"/> precast to get extra phase 2 DPS and better <Boon name="Quickness"/>/<Boon name="Fury"/> uptime after the <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> changes (especially if you want to run with <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> instead of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>).
</Boss>

- When <Specialization name="Berserker"/> is running to precast his banners run with him and precast <Skill id="5624"/> behind the boss hitbox

- Go to the boss using portal or <Skill id="5697"/> and drop your <Skill id="5516"/> to not get stuck on staff. Cast <Skill id="5501"/> where MAMA spawns.

- If the CC Bar is not broken when you use <Skill id="44612"/> then cast <Skill id="5691"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -><Skill id="5557"/> so that you might get <Skill id="5557"/> in the break bar.

### _1st Add_

- Throw your <Skill id="5516"/> where the 2nd knight spawns and use <Skill id="5517"/> on add.

### **3rd Phase**

- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="5539"/> -><Skill id="44612"/> -><Skill id="5557"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/>.

- Precast <Skill id="40183"/> when boss is about to land.

- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="5539"/> -><Skill id="44612"/> -><Skill id="5691"/> -> <Skill id="44451"/> -><Skill id="5557"/>.

<Warning>

This build only works if you kill Siax in less than 55 seconds. If there is any doubt about the kill time, go with the PuG version.
</Warning>

In more organised groups it's recommended to run <Specialization name="Tempest"/>+<Skill name="conjurelightninghammer"/> precast to get extra phase 2 DPS and better <Boon name="Quickness"/>/<Boon name="Fury"/> uptime after the <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> changes (especially if you want to run with <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> instead of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/>).
</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> and <Skill id="5737"/> on boss hitbox

- **NOTE:** If there is <Instability name="Vengeance"/> or <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and adds have <Boon name="Protection"/> it's recommended to use <Skill id="5697"/> from adds back to move towards siax and provide more help for guardian with killing echo. You have to be **very** fast in that phase otherwise you will loose a lot of your phase 2 burst.

### **2nd Phase**

- It's the most important part for you as <Specialization name="weaver"/>. You have to be as fast as possible to get proper burst in <Effect name="Exposed"/> after changes ( 4s <Effect name="Exposed"/> duration ).

- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>-><Skill id="44451"/>-> <Skill id="5557"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> -> Attune back to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> with remaining <Skill id="44612"/>

- When boss is about 36-33% pick up <Skill id="5516"/>.

- **NOTE:** Be careful with tether mechanic to not blow up your allies. If you are fast and have a close eye on others echos it's possible to precast <Skill id="43803"/> and use <Skill id="5691"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> priority to get full <Effect name="Exposed"/> dmg and additional <Trait id="1510"/> stacks from tethers, but you have to be insanely fast.

### _2nd Add_

- <Skill id="5517"/> to add, use few autos from your <Skill id="5516"/> and <Skill id="5697"/> through the echo back to boss.

- If you have troubles with that part you can use 1-2 ticks from <Skill id="40183"/> to give deal some additional <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> on add.

- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> on Siax.

### **3rd Phase**

- <Skill id="43803"/> -> <Skill id="45313"/> -> <Skill id="5529"/> -> <Skill id="43074"/> -> <Skill id="44612"/>-> <Skill id="44451"/> -> <Skill id="5691"/> -> auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> -> <Skill id="5557"/> -> Attune back to <Skill id="5494"/> for additional dmg from <Trait id="222"/>

- If timers are slow you will be able to skip auto chain in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> for <Skill id="5557"/> instantly.

Use first <Skill id="40183"/> precasted for instant <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, if phases are long try to use the next ones in <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> -> <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> to get more <Condition name="Burning"/> stacks.
</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Throw <Skill id="5516"/> for <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> inside his/her circle.

- **NOTE:** Do not hesitate to use <Skill id="40709"/>, <Skill id="46447"/>, <Skill id="44405"/> if things are going hot. Just keep in mind to be on <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> just as phase starts.

<Warning>

One of the most important things in this fight is to keep up <Boon name="Might"/> and boons at the four _Elite Flux Anomalies_. To achieve this you need to be fast enough with your damage, hit your blasts correctly and not get hit by the shockwaves and knockbacks.
</Warning>
</Boss>

### **Precast**

- Cast <Skill id="5531"/>, drop your <Skill id="5516"/> and cast <Skill id="5501"/> where Skorvald spawns. Equip your Sword/Dagger and attune to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5494"/> before the <Skill id="5501"/> animation finishes and start the boss!

- Go through the portal for phase 2 when anomaly is on about 30-40% of health.

### **Phase 2**
