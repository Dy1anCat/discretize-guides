</Boss>

### **Precast**

<Warning>

Boons get removed upon entering combat here, so stacking them is pointless. Effects will stay though so take advantage of that and precast what you can.

</Warning>

- Optionally before pre-stacking you can get into combat by jumping off the side of the map. This allows you to pre-stack on weapon swap sigils such as <Item id="24609"/> and <Item id="24599"/>. While in combat you can also precast <Trait name="Poison MAster"/> by using a <Skill id="42944"/> ability.

- <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> while merged with Bristleback then swap to your desired pet and enter <Skill id="42944"/> (If you are staying with Bristleback you can cast <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> a second time after taking the _Mistlock Singularity_)

- With <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> selected, use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> and dodge twice.

- As you are dodging cast <Skill name="Vulture stance"/>, <Skill name="sharpening stone"/>, <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and <Skill name="moa stance"/>

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/>

- Take mistlock _Mistlock Singularity_ and swap any skills back you have changed.

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/> again

- As you walk into the arena make sure to stack <Trait id="1912"/> for some extra initial damage.

- Cast <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> so it spawns towards the middle of the arena.

<Warning>

In pug groups it is recommended to cc Ai in the middle of the arena. This will give you the maximum amount of time to DPS Ai, which will allow most groups to skip most of the split phases. On SLB you don't want to delay your <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> as it will stop you from swapping to Dagger/Torch and dealing as much damage, but you should delay your <Skill id="46432"/> if you need to. Ideally Ai's CC bar should break as the Red Agony field spawns beneath her.

</Warning>

### _Air Phase_

- As you get into combat cast <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.

- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- Cast <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- Remember to dodge as often as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> as they come off cool-down.

- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to the middle of the arena and as the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you don't get demerged,

- After the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>. As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the air split phase happens).

### _Fire Phase_

<Warning>

Ideally your group will use a Xera portal to get back to the middle to DPS Ai quickly. Make sure you communicate with your team before the fight to work out if you or someone else will drop one.

</Warning>

- Start this phase on Dagger/Torch

- As the split phase ends take a Xera portal back to the middle casting <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> as you go through.

- Once in the middle use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and swap to Shortbow.

- Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.Keep DPSing until you need to head to the safe spot by the Meteor. Once it is safe to leave follow Ai to the side, calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- As you reach the side use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and continue with your rotation.

- Follow Ai to the middle of the arena and as the expanding AoE's appear swap to Shortbow and use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you don't get demerged,

- After the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>. As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the meteors fall).

### _Water Phase_

<Warning>

There is not much you can do in the split phase here, so just make sure to keep an eye on tethers and to give/take them if you or someone else is close to 9 stacks. If your <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> has died remember to summon it towards the end of the split phase. It is also beneficial to be in the middle of the arena her so you have less distance to walk when Ai dashes to the side again.

</Warning>

- Summon <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> if it has died shortly before ai becomes vulnerable,

- Once vulnerable cast <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.

- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- Cast <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- Remember to dodge as often as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> as they come off cool-down.

- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to the middle of the arena.

- As the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you don't get demerged, and after the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the water split phase happens).

- If the water split happens, there is not much you can do since Ai will reflect all projectiles, so help your team by standing in the greens and taking tethers. Once the split phase finishes Ai should be on low health, so follow her if she dashes and continue with your rotation until she phases.

### **Precast**

<Warning>

</Warning>

- Optionally before pre-stacking you can get into combat by jumping off the side of the map. This allows you to pre-stack on weapon swap sigils such as <Item id="24609"/> and <Item id="24599"/>.

- As you are dodging cast <Skill name="Vulture stance"/>, <Skill name="sharpening stone"/>, <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and <Skill name="moa stance"/>

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/>

- Take mistlock _Mistlock Singularity_ and swap any skills back you have changed.

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/> again

- As you walk into the arena make sure to stack <Trait id="1912"/> for some extra initial damage.

- Cast <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> so it spawns towards the middle of the arena.

<Warning>

In pug groups it is recommended to cc Ai after she dashes from the side on the 100%-66% phase. This will give you the maximum amount of time to DPS Ai to 66% stopping some mechanics from overlapping as you go to CC the first Sorrow. On SLB you don't want to delay your <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> as it will stop you from swapping to Dagger/Torch and dealing as much damage, but you should delay your <Skill id="46432"/> if you need to. Ideally Ai's CC bar should break as the Red Agony field spawns beneath her. After 66% you should CC Ai if you can, but it is more important to make sure you have enough CC to break the Sorrows so you don't wipe.

</Warning>

### _100% - 66%_

- As you get into combat cast <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.

- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- Cast <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- Remember to dodge as often as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> as they come off cool-down.

- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to her next location.

- as the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you don't get demerged,

- After the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>. As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai phases.

### _66% - 33%_

<Warning>

Your rotation from here will depend on your groups DPS and Ai's RNG. In general remember to dodge as much as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use your mobility skills to keep attacking Ai as much as you can. <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> will probably die a couple of times so make sure you re-summon it as soon as you can, and call it to you when you move. Finally CC Ai when you can, but also remember to use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/> to keep up <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/>.

</Warning>

- Follow Ai to the middle of the arena summoning <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> as soon as you can and camp Shortbow until the first Sorrow spawns. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> to CC.

- Use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- At this point Ai will either stay in the middle or dash to the side. If Ai dashes be prepared to follow calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> when you can.

- Quickly swap to Shortbow and use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back as Fears will be closing in, and continue with your rotation camping Shortbow until the Split mechanic happens.

- After the split mechanic re-summon <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> if it has died and swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai phases at 33%.

### _33% - 0%_

- At this point aim to be on Shortbow so you can CC a Sorrow with <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and if you need <Skill id="46432"/>.

- Use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- At this point Ai will either stay in the middle or dash to the side. If Ai dashes be prepared to follow calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> when you can.

- Quickly swap to Shortbow and use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back as Fears will be closing in, and continue with your rotation camping Shortbow until the Split mechanic happens.

- After the split mechanic re-summon <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> if it has died and swap to Dagger/Torch continuing with your rotation until Ai dies.
