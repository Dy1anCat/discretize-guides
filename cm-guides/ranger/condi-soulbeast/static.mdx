- Pet: <Skill id="41206" disableText/> Bristleback for dps. <Skill id="46432" disableText/> Warthog if your group needs the CC.

- Take <Trait id="2128"/>.

- <Trait id="1912"/>.

- <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> can be replaced with <Skill id="45970"/> this allows your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> to lower their boon duration and deal substantially more DPS! Alternatively if you have more than one <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, one can drop <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/>. Just remember to sync up <Skill id="45970"/> with <Skill id="45537"/> so <Boon name="Alacrity"/> doesn't drop.

- <Skill name="Quick shot"/> and <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> are great movement abilities for following Ai when dashing and also to dodge suicidal teammates.

- There is an invisible hitbox in the center of the arena so use <Skill id="41206"/> there for a big DPS.

- For this encounter swapping shortbow for Axe/Dagger can work well in high DPS groups due to Ai getting phased at the side and not dashing much.

</Boss>

<Warning>
The following guide assumes your group will CC Ai at the side of the arena; and will phase at the side or shortly after, Your comp and pet choice will change the amount of CC required and skill usage, so be prepared to adjust your rotation.
</Warning>

### **Precast**

<Warning>
Boons get removed upon entering combat here, so stacking them is pointless. Effects will stay though so take advantage of that and precast what you can.
</Warning>

- Optionally before pre-stacking you can get into combat by jumping off the side of the map. This allows you to pre-stack on weapon swap sigils such as <Item id="24609"/> and <Item id="24599"/>. While in combat you can also precast <Trait name="Poison MAster"/> by using a <Skill id="42944"/> ability.

- <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> while merged with Bristleback then swap to your desired pet and enter <Skill id="42944"/> (If you are staying with Bristleback you can cast <Skill name="Sharpen Spines"/> a second time after taking the _Mistlock Singularity_)

- With <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> selected, use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> and dodge twice.

- As you are dodging cast <Skill name="Vulture stance"/>, <Skill name="sharpening stone"/>, <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and <Skill name="moa stance"/>

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/>

- Take mistlock _Mistlock Singularity_ and swap any skills back you have changed.

- Cast <Skill name="Double Arc"/> again

- As you walk into the arena make sure to stack <Trait id="1912"/> for some extra initial damage.

- Cast <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> so it spawns towards the middle of the arena.

- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/> and CC with <Skill id="46432"/>.

- Swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.

- As they come off cool-down use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/>.

- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to the middle of the arena calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you as soon as you can. Use your Shortbow and <Skill id="42944"/> skills until the boss phases, ideally before the expanding AoE's fill.

- If Ai hasn't phased use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you don't get demerged, and continue with your rotation swapping back to Dagger/Torch after you get back to the middle.

### _Fire Phase_

<Warning>
Ideally your group will use a Xera portal to get back to the middle to DPS Ai quickly. If you are running <Trait name="Quickdraw"/> make sure someone else uses their portal as the trait will proc when you open portal which isn't ideal.
</Warning>

- Start this phase on Dagger/Torch

- As the split phase ends take a Xera portal back to the middle casting <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> as you go through.

- Once in the middle use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.Keep DPSing until you need to head to the safe spot by the Meteor. Once it is safe to leave follow Ai to the side, calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- As you reach the side use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/> to CC and call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.

- Use <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and continue with your rotation until Ai phases.

### _Water Phase_

<Warning>
There is not much you can do in the split phase here, so just make sure to keep an eye on tethers and to give/take them if you or someone else is close to 9 stacks. If your <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> has died remember to summon it towards the end of the split phase.
</Warning>

- As Ai becomes vulnerable use <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.

Your rotation from here will depend on your groups DPS and Ai's RNG. In general remember to dodge as much as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use your mobility skills to keep attacking Ai as much as you can. <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> will probably die a couple of times so make sure you re-summon it as soon as you can, and call it to you when you move. Finally CC Ai when you can, but also remember to use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/> (If you run Warthog) to keep up <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/>.
</Warning>

### _66% - 33%_

- Follow Ai to the middle of the arena summoning <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> as soon as you can and camp Shortbow until the first Sorrow spawns. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> to CC.

- As they come off cool-down use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/>.

- At this point Ai will either stay in the middle or dash to the side. If Ai dashes be prepared to follow.

- Quickly swap to Shortbow and use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back as Fears will be closing in, and camp Shortbow until Ai reaches 33%.

- Help to CC Ai if you can, but don't waste cool-downs you will need to CC the Sorrows at 33%. Be prepared to split if you don't reach 33% before the agony field appears in the middle.

### _33% - 0%_
