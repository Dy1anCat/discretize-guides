long_description: The Aetherblade Fractal has you heading through rooms filled
  with traps and puzzles, facing off against a gang of fearsome airship pirates.
  Resulting in an encounter with the not so happy to see you Asura Frizz, and
  his Golems. Remember to bring stability, stunbreaks, and bind your dodge key
  to fly through this fractal.

## Start (water tunnel) <Item id="50082" disableText/>

## Lasers <Item id="50082" disableText/>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="9">

After the door opens, you enter a large area with two deadly laser puzzles.

The first one consists of a _moving laser square pattern_ and can be disabled by activating four consoles inside a small room at the end of it. Pressing a console applies <Condition name="Immobile"/> to you.

The second area is filled with _spinning lasers_. In exactly the same way as before, four consoles around the area have to be activated to disable the traps.

You don't need to kill a single mob and can bypass all traps with the following steps:

1.  One person (or more) teleports up to the first level and activates all four consoles using condition cleanses
2.  Everyone does `/gg` and resurrects immediately (you will spawn on the ramp up after the first console room)
3.  The team splits up to activate the second set of consoles (the spinning lasers won't be active if you're fast enough)

Speed is important here. Do not hesitate to `/gg` if you are certain the first console will be completed.

## Final room (Frizz) <Item id="8887" disableText size="large"/><Item id="24672" disableText size="large" />

<Grid>
<GridItem>

Talk to _Inspector Ellen Kiel_ to teleport your party into the final room. Stack <Boon name="Might"/> as soon as you are in.

Initially, Frizz and two Inquest approach. Talk to Frizz to begin the fight. As soon as Frizz reaches 75%, he teleports to the middle and becomes invulnerable.

After about five seconds, the first _Aetherblade Golem_ wakes up and two _Small Lasers_ start spinning, splitting the room in two. You can avoid the small lasers by jumping on the pile of boxes around the arena.

When the first golem dies, the two _Small Lasers_ disappear and two _Aetherblade Golem_ wake up. _Large Lasers_ start spinning which you can only bypass entirely with <Effect name="Invulnerability"/>.

As soon as the two golem are dead, the two _Small Lasers_ **and** the two _Large Lasers_ spin simultaneously and two final golem wake up. Kill the last golem to finish the fight.

If a golem walks through a laser, it powers up and blocks all attacks for a short time. Pay attention to their <Control name="Pull"/> attack, though it should not be a problem with high damage.
<Achievement title="Still Faster Than Light">
Don't get hit by the lasers! The hardest part is when all lasers are up, rotating at different speeds.
