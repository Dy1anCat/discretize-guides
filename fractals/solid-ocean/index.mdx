## Start

As you enter the fractal, the only obstacle between you and the boss is your own jumping puzzle skill and the _Irukandji_, _Jade Shards_. The way to the boss is not really challenging, and most groups will run directly to the boss and avoid all mobs. If you happen to be in combat, jumping through will be a little bit harder, but nothing extraordinary.

Use <Effect name="Stealth"/> to skip the mobs easily or condition cleanses to remove the <Condition name="Chilled"/> the mobs can apply. Before doing the final jump onto the boss platform next to the Mistlock Singularity, make sure to have <Boon name="Swiftness"/> so you don't fall to your death, as it will apply <Effect name="Agony"/> to you mid-air.

## Jade Maw

After jumping across a few jade blocks, you are now in the main boss area. The fight has 3 main phases.

### Phase 1

When you first enter the area, you will see two _Jade Tentacles_ and a few groups of _Irukandji_. Kill the tentacles quickly to move on to the next phase.

Note that the _Jade Tentacles_ have two skills, a huge spinning AoE (get used to the telegraph to avoid/dodge it) and a slam attack that can be side-stepped or dodged. Note that the tentacles are vulnerable to CCs such as <Control name="Pull"/>, <Control name="Stun"/>, or <Control name="Daze"/>. Use these to interrupt their attacks.

### Phase 2

After killing the first _Jade Tentacles_, the second phase begins and a new group of tentacles spawns. Along with them, new mobs called _Jade Colossi_ start spawning.

Beginning in this phase, killing these mobs will cause them to spawn _Reflecting Crystals_.

These crystals are important, as the boss will start targeting random players with a large red skull over their head. The skull is an indicator of a massive attack that will instantly down the player or cause them to lose their mistlock if they do not find a way to negate it.

To negate the attack, simply pick up a _Reflecting Crystal_ when you have the skull over your head. When the attack hits, you will get a temporary 1 skill. Target the Jade Maw's eye and launch the crystal at it using this skill, which will do about 5% of the boss's HP.

You **can** dodge the attack. Dodging right after the skull leaves your head will evade the attack, so you can avoid going down if you are not in range of a crystal in time. however, your priority should be to use the crystals for the attacks, as this will speed up the time it takes to clear the fractal.

The only other way to damage the boss is by killing the _Jade Tentacles_. Each tentacle will remove 3-4% of the boss's HP. However, the damaging effect from killing a tentacle cannot trigger more than once at the same time.

**DO NOT** kill all _Jade Tentacles_ at once, but move from tentacle to tentacle while reflecting attacks and killing the _Jade Colossi_ to move to the last phase.

\*The _Jade Colossi_ spawn with a reflecting aura that can be removed using non-projectile based CC skills\*\* such as <Control name="Stun"/> or <Control name="Daze"/>. The _Jade Colossi_ has 3 skills, a far reaching skill that applies <Condition name="Crippled"/>, an AoE <Control name="Knockdown"/> and a reflecting aura that looks like <Specialization name="Elementalist"/>'s <Skill name="Magnetic Aura" profession="Elementalist"/>, the _Jade Colossus_ mostly activates this aura after it got it's reflect stripped.

### Phase 3

After killing the last _Jade Colossi_, a fresh set of _Jade Tentacles_ will spawn, and the boss will increase the frequency of the red skull attack. The same rules apply here.

Continue reflecting crystals and killing tentacles until the boss reaches 8%. This will trigger one final attack, targeting all players. Each person picks up a crystal, blocking the attack and finishing off the boss.

Congratulations, you finished the fractal.
